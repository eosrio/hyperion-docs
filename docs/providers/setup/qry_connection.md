# What is QRY
QRY is a decentralized ecosystem designed to provide seamless access to various data services and APIs. The initial release of QRY prioritizes the Antelope Web3 ecosystem, granting users dependable access to these services while offering rewards to incentivize service providers.

For Antelope Service Providers, QRY introduces new revenue streams for essential services like Hyperion, Chain API, and Atomic Assets, which have previously lacked defined rewards.

With QRY actively under development, the ecosystem is currently in its foundational phase. The QRY team invites interested providers to register and contribute to the ongoing development of the QRY HUB.

   - Follow the steps below to log in with `cleos`:
      - Select `cleos`, enter your Account Name and Permission, and generate the Cleos Command.
      - Copy the generated command and paste it into your `cleos` CLI to produce your signature. Submit this signature on the registration page.

   - Complete the **Register Instance Page** by adding a Keypair, selecting "Hyperion" as the Service Type, and entering your Public API.
   - Save the keys generated here for QRY HUB authentication.

#### **Configure Hyperion**

   - Edit the `chains/wax.config.json` file to include the instance key under the `"hub"` section.

      ```json
      "hub": {
        "instance_key": "PVT_K1_2VGf8RznDRPkNNofhRwvHYs2puU5YQkVcB7bnWFhmFKE6gPdm1"
      },
      ```

      ```shell
      cd ~/hyperion-history-api
      pm2 start --only wax-api --update-env
      ```

   - PM2 logs will confirm the APIâ€™s connection to the QRY HUB.
